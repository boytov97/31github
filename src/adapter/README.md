## Adapter

An adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together.

This is a translator object that transforms the interface or data of one object into such a form that it becomes understandable to another object.

##### Comprises:

- Client interface
- Adapter class
- Interface / class which we adapter into client interface
